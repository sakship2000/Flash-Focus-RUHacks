Sensation - awareness resulting from the stimulation of a sense organ
Perception - the organization and interpretation of sensations
These work together seamlessly to help us experience the world.
Our focus: the 6 senses: seeing, hearing, smelling, touching, tasting and monitoring the
body's positions (proprioception)
Transduction - the conversion of stimuli detected by receptor cells to electrical impulses
that are then transported to the brain
5.1 We Experience Our World through Sensation
Psychophysics - branch of psychology that studies the effects of physical stimuli on
sensory perceptions and mental states
- Founded by German psychologist Gustav Fechner (1801-1887)
Studies relationship between strength of stimulus and a person's ability to
detect it
Absolute threshold of a sensation - the intensity of a stimulus that allows an organism
to just barely detect it
o a criterion to help determine the limits of human sensation
Signal detection analysis - a technique used to determine the ability of the perceiver to
separate true signals from background noise
The analysis of the data from a psychophysics experiment creates two measures:
1) Sensitivity - the true ability of the individual to detect the presence or absence of
signals
2) Response bias - behavioural tendency to respond "yes" to the trials which is
independent of sensitivity.
a. Ex. Soldier on battlefield sends up warning signal even if (s)he hears the
faintest of sounds
Difference threshold (or just noticeable difference (JND]) - the change in a stimulus that
can just barely be detected by the organism
o Another criterion that concerns the ability to assess differences between
stimuli
German physiologist Ernst Weber discovered: the ability to detect
differences depends not so much on the size of the difference but on the
